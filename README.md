# Attendance Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Attendance Dashboard is a web application that provides an interface for tracking and managing attendance records. It is built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, incorporating real-time data functionality using Socket.IO. The dashboard visualizes attendance metrics with charts facilitated by Chart.js and allows for user authentication.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-dashboard.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd attendance-dashboard
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment variables as needed, such as database connection strings and secret keys. 

## Usage
To run the application locally, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This command starts the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Testing
To run tests, use:
```bash
npm test
```
